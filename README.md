# Bug-fix Bot
The bug fix bot is a bot that takes in a snippet of broken codes, ranging from C/C++ to Python. After that, it would then analyzes and give out an answer on how to fix the code, and recommendations on optimizing or fixing the code.

Elements and tools used for the bug-fix bot:
- Python on Visual Studio Code (Main base codes and connectivity)
- Google Vertex AI (Germini) for main functions
- Google Cloud for API keys
- Streamlit for the User Interface

This is the final project of my Artificial Intelligence class (ECPE 151), so I enjoyed what I managed to build and learned a lot about creating API keys and Streamlit.
